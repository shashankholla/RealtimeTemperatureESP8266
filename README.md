# RealtimeTemperatureESP8266

Send realtime temperature and humidity data from Arduino UNO using ESP8266 to website hosted on your favorite dynamic site hosting platform.

    

- This project aims at collecting real-time physical data from an agricultural farm, displaying it in a graphical way and automating farming process.
- It involves collecting physical parameters like soil moisture, water level in water tanks, temperature, humidity and sunlight.
- It aims at making this data available on any device connected to the Internet by storing it on a custom local server.
- It also involves developing an Android based application to receive notifications upon critical conditions in farm.
- It aims at implementing a web and app based system to control irrigation.
